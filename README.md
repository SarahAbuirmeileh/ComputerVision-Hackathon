# Computer Vision Hackathon 🏆
Welcome to our exciting Computer Vision Hackathon! 🎉 In this hackathon, we will be crafting an ExpressJS application that delves into the fascinating realm of AI and computer vision. The best part? You won't be starting from scratch! 🚀 We're harnessing the power of AWS AI services to create an amazing project. Let the coding magic commence! 💻🔥

## Introduction to Amazon AI Services 🔥
Amazon AI Services is a comprehensive suite of artificial intelligence offerings by Amazon Web Services (AWS), empowering developers with machine learning capabilities. With an amalgamation of user-friendly tools, robust algorithms, and pre-trained models, it enables businesses to tackle a diverse range of challenges, from chatbots to predictive analytics.

In this challenge, our focus will be on one standout service: AWS Rekognition.

## AWS Rekognition 🌠
Within the array of AWS AI tools, Rekognition takes the spotlight as the go-to solution for image and video analysis. It eliminates the need for building deep learning algorithms from scratch, seamlessly identifying objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in images and videos. It even boasts the ability to detect inappropriate content.

Explore the service page here to discover its various features and use cases.

## Challenge Description 🔮
Our ultimate goal is to launch an ExpressJS application with three primary functionalities for users:

* Identification: Recognize objects, scenes, and actions within an image.
